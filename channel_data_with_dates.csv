HEAL NATURALLY FROM ARTHRITIS WITH THE BEST NATURAL MEDICATION. My Absolute Recovery From Rheumatoid arthritis With Traditional Herbal Medication. Hello. I&#39;m JOHN It was a sad experience for me after I had found out I had been diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis. At first at the realization of the news, I was taken aback because I had never wanted to be in a position that would be difficult to handle. It was of some sad oddity to even realize that the pharmaceutical medication that was recommended was not favorable to me at all. My finger outlines were deformed and as I was hurt every single moment, the pain was unbearable and I was desperately in search of a permanent remedy to get rid of this dreadful disease called arthritis. I was soon to deviate another alternative in improving my condition naturally. It was during my ceaseless search for a definite remedy that I stumbled across the professional works of Dr. ATTEH - an African herbal practitioner and natural healer whose works had surrounded natural herbs and their benefits from mostly Dr. Sebi&#39;s theory and who had completely saved me from Rheumatoid arthritis. An information was passed online of his professional experience in healing most incurable ailments via a naturopathic process. The content of the information had elaborated that the process of his healing was traditionally and naturally oriented and that the aforementioned herbalist had successfully cured a number of victims from most viral ailments such as Arthritis, Asthma-related problems, erectile dysfunction, paralysis, hepatitis B , lupus, and many other medical conditions via traditional methods of healing. For proper understanding and guidelines, I had contacted this African herbalist with whose professional directions and his recommendations I was able to receive my healing naturally without any side effects at all and under only a little period of time. I wish to use this opportunity to reach out to any person who by faith may stumble across this piece of information and who may be facing any health challenges currently, to hopefully reach out to this natural herbal healer for assistance in battling their health problems. I would highly recommend this African doctor&#39;s herbal medication to anyone battling any viral disease for proper medication in improving their conditions.

Ironically China in its own way has copied the New Deal and its now booming and doing the big programs that are growing its economy that America was once famous for doing.

Not in a white community ? yes in a\xa0white community too. Few in Michigan understand the regulatory compliance requirements of operating a water waste treatment facility in the state of Michigan .There is a multi level license structure for class A, B C and D grade facilities\xa0based on the amount of volume of water waste flow coming through the\xa0plant.\xa0\xa0Each facility needs several license holders to operate safely the various 24 hour plant\xa0shifts. Some one with a license needs to be on site all the time. Who were the licensed\xa0operators In Flint ? Why have these individuals not been identified ? Flint is not the only city which has had serious operational and over sight problems . The story starts 3-4 years ago when it became clear how many facilities throughout the state had no licensed operator , a scary thought . After\xa0bringing it to the attention of the DEQ and various other agencies they decided to tighten up their records to make them look on paper as if licensed operators were in control. They forced unlicensed facilities to engage out of town 3rd party consultants down state to\xa0run operations on paper. The problem is I don&#39;t think that&#39;s legal. Think you can only manage one facility at a time and you need to be on site. \xa0I keep hearing this wouldn&#39;t happen in a white community and I say yes it does you just don&#39;t hear about it . For instance\xa0 Mackinac Island hadn&#39;t had a licensed waste water treatment operator in the last 15 years until finally this past year. Problem is it&#39;s still not legal or adequate because the DEQ calls for a class C or B license because of the heavy volume of water during the summer months kicks it up a few classes compared to winter flow rates. Currently only a class D operator is running the facility\xa0The Governor and all the GOP buddies hanging at the Grand Hotel didn&#39;t know that for the last 5 of 6 years they didn&#39;t have a licensed operator when they went to\xa0 the bathroom. Turn about its fair play and yes even the Governor &#39;s own back yard there was a problem too.The list of Northern Michigan towns\xa0that do\xa0not have\xa0licensed operators is alarming. Think the DEQ knew that ? The list of serious concerns do not end with the people consuming the finished product but also include the employees operating the plant . Few if any emergency action plans exist. Training is non existent on what to do in the event of a serious problem or system shut down.\xa0Few plant operators know how to put on a haz mat suit\xa0and even fewer know\xa0how to take one off. For Instance on Mackinac when they had a big fire a few years ago the fire department and plant operators both just looked at each other and had no idea of what to do. No reports on how much ammonia or chlorine gas were released. All of the license holders for the occupation of water waste treatment facilities are all on the DLEG dept of licensing web site. Try and match up enough license holders for all the plants across the state and you are going to see a lot of redundant names and they can&#39;t be at all these plants at the same time . The simple fact is there are not enough license holders period . The DEQ and EPA are fed lab results from every plant in the state on a daily /weekly basis\xa0. A close scrutiny of the lab reports needs to be conducted by 3rd party peer review.\xa0\xa0\xa0Detoit&#39;s water system is not without it&#39;s past problems also. Not sure who has been running the Detroit plants since the director was arrested by the Justice Department with Kwame Kilpatrick?

I&#39;m one of the first &quot;Bernie Or Bust&quot; true Bernie believers. I have pledged that I will ONLY vote for Bernie Sanders. It doesn&#39;t matter to me if Bernie is with the &quot;Bud Lite&quot; Party. I will write his name in, if his name is not already on the ballot.<br><br>I have sworn that I will gladly write his name in my own blood on the ballot, if it comes down to that. I believe that my vote counts. But, this is the only WAY in which it counts. A vote only counts when cast to express an AFFIRMATIVE purpose. Currently, it&#39;s not possible (nor is it preferable), to vote AGAINST a party or politician. If I&#39;m not voting my conscience, I&#39;m wasting my vote.<br><br>I hear it suggested soo often that if you&#39;re not voting for a candidate that holds the nomination for a major political party, that you are then &quot;throwing your vote away&quot;. I REFUSE to accept that. I choose instead to believe that at the end of this election season there is going to be a YUGE number of misguided fellow Americans throwing their votes away because THEY refuse to believe that they have any other choice. I&#39;m determined not to fall into that Trump.,<br><br>Its because of this kind of backwards thinking that we are in such a screwed up situation now. Fear of the truth is what fuels that kind of defective, group-think. I&#39;m convinced that it&#39;s because of fear and ignorance we are continuing the process of compromising everything.<br><br>I believe that I will always have the right to vote for Bernie Sanders. Even if I&#39;m the last and only man on Earth that votes for him, that is EXACTLY what I&#39;m going to do. And, I believe that this is EXACTLY the same sort of fighting spirit I have in common with everyone else in this country that has brand him or herself as a &quot;Bernie Believers&quot;. True patriotism has a new name and this is it.<br> <br>No other candidate has the honor, integrity, or moral character that Bernie Sanders has. I refuse to compromise anymore. Nobody has the right to tell me I&#39;m wrong for not believing the numerous lies that soo many others seem so quick and ready to accept. One of which by the way is, that your vote only counts if you can pick the winner.<br><br>People have gotten it all twisted. And, the media is no help with this. Your vote counts no matter who wins. Being able to predict the outcome in advance is NOT the point! That has got to be the most backwards thinking, small minded, short sighted, moraly bankrupt way to view things. I have nothing but contempt in my heart for those that fear what is supposed to make us all stronger.<br><br>Being able to live with yourself after you step out of the voting booth is what matters. Being a part of this historic, non-violent, grassroots radical REVOLUTION is what matters. Insisting and demanding that the system change in order to serve more people better is supposed to be what really matters. It&#39;s as important as (and, is connected with), the task of voting itself. Taking ownership of my rights, duty, role, responsibility and opportunity to engage fully in this political process is what matters.<br><br>Quality government is possible. But, only if we start getting quality people elected! Bernie is just the first (albeit, most important), of many new progressive political leaders to come. And, I am a part of that coming storm designed to sweep away the corrupted ways of the past.<br><br>&quot;A storm is coming; our storm. And, when it arrives it will shake the universe.&quot; - Dune<br><br>Fate whispers to the man &quot;You cannot withstand the storm&quot; and the man whispers back - &quot;I am the storm&quot;.<br><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FeelTheBeen"">#FeelTheBeen</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NotMeUs"">#NotMeUs</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieOrBust"">#BernieOrBust</a>  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ElectionFraud"">#ElectionFraud</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Vets4Bernie"">#Vets4Bernie</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CountTheProvisionalBallots"">#CountTheProvisionalBallots</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Daeshbags"">#Daeshbags</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23WriteBernieSandersIn"">#WriteBernieSandersIn</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AnyBlueWontDo"">#AnyBlueWontDo</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieSaidItFirst"">#BernieSaidItFirst</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23HillaryLiesMatter"">#HillaryLiesMatter</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MassDNCVoterFraud"">#MassDNCVoterFraud</a><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NotMyAbuela"">#NotMyAbuela</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BreakEmUp"">#BreakEmUp</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23WeAreTheStorm"">#WeAreTheStorm</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23IWillNeverVoteForHillary"">#IWillNeverVoteForHillary</a><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23HillaryForPrison"">#HillaryForPrison</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CronyMediaSellout"">#CronyMediaSellout</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23StopEndlessWar"">#StopEndlessWar</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EndCorporateWelfare"">#EndCorporateWelfare</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EndForProfitPrisons"">#EndForProfitPrisons</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EndCitizensUnited"">#EndCitizensUnited</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieMadeMeWhite"">#BernieMadeMeWhite</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23HillNo"">#HillNo</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ReleaseTheTranscripts"">#ReleaseTheTranscripts</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BernieMadeMeYoung"">#BernieMadeMeYoung</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ToneDownForWhat"">#ToneDownForWhat</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DropOutHillary"">#DropOutHillary</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23StillSanders"">#StillSanders</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ExitPollGate"">#ExitPollGate</a><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DemocraticSuperdelegateObstructionism"">#DemocraticSuperdelegateObstructionism</a><br><br><a href=""http://drpj.weebly.com/anti-democratic-practices.html"">http://drpj.weebly.com/anti-democratic-practices.html</a>'}, {'author_display_name': 'Giglia Pages', 'comment_text': 'Love him!!!!!'}, {'author_display_name': '4TheRepublic', 'comment_text': 'feel the taxes'}, {'author_display_name': 'topgun1792', 'comment_text': '&quot;ehhh you take a plane... im fine&quot;<br>This guy should be VP'}, {'author_display_name': 'Bethany D', 'comment_text': 'Bernie Sanders POTUS 2016!!!

Sure you should teach children to obey the rules within reason. <br><br>I disagree with comparing this situation which involves a young person to an adult torturing someone for information cause:<br> 1. Torture is unreliable as their is no guarantee that the information is accurate and there are plenty of cases where people have falsely confessed under interrogation without the actual use of physical torture, so I&#39;d imagine real torture might produce the same results, or the person being tortured tells the interrogator the wrong information out of spite.<br>2. It is an adult situation and ethical dilemma, which is pretty much a hypothetical scenario as the guy himself suggests ticking time bombs are more of a Hollywood invention.<br>3. The kid didn&#39;t hurt anyone by saving his classmate&#39;s life. Now I could see him facing detention if they swore or talked to the teacher disrespectfully as they defied them, though if I had been the teacher and (not realizing the girl was in need of prompt medical intervention) after the fact would have recognized the kid made the right call, and I would have just told the principal/administration that it was a heat of the moment thing and wouldn&#39;t have held it against the kid as I would be an adult and accept responsibility for my own failure to take the necessary action before I&#39;d let a kid be punished for doing the right thing. I would be proud a student of mine realizing the seriousness of the situation took the initiative to take action to save someone&#39;s life (as I consider that a sign of good moral character, as blind obedience to authorityis not the American way as history has proven time and again). Besides that teacher should be thankful that kid saved that girl, cause had they waited the teacher would probably be living with having a asthmatic child die in their care because of their failure to recognize the seriousness of the situation and act accordingly.<br><br>I agree it sends the wrong kind of message and that they should just be glad that girl is alive and that young man took a risk to save a life.'}, {'author_display_name': 'Le Medic', 'comment_text': 'School: &quot;What? you were bullied? physically and mentally?

Instead of blaming the doll company, parents should talk with their children and let them know that dolls are fun but in real life he/she is more beautiful and special than any doll. I think that is also a problem with our society. We want our children to see themselves as beautiful so we buy them dolls that look just like them. What we should be really teaching them is that everyone is beautiful in their own way whether tall, short, black, white, tan, handicapped, disabled, thin, wide, curvy petite, etc. Let them understand that and they will realize just how awesome they really are. That&#39;s just my honest opinion.

What was ABC news doing there giving them a false sense of security and then covering up the murder?

There is also video testimony that someone found documentation at the refuge of payoffs to the sheriff opposed to the demonstration. <br>There was also a recording of Ammon Bundy&#39;s conversation with Chris, the pseudonym of the crisis negotiator. At Chris&#39;s request, Ammon Bundy describes the testimony he has recorded of ranchers who were interviewed by the DA about the Hammond case.

Shooting at the vehicle does not stop until a car happens on the roadblock and the family sees smoke pouring from the Lavoy&#39;s vehicle. <br>If I can find out these things just by looking at documents and videos, shouldn‚Äôt the media and the FBI be launching investigations of the sheriff, DA, the shooters, and the groups trying to cover up the criminal activities?

Old, and his views are sometimes antiquated,<br>But Jesus is alive in heaven-and manifests himself here through the Holy Spirit. One of his miracles works is deliverance from demons. Not everything is demonic. Not all music is demonic nor all rock music. But to completely deny evidence of either 1. Evil or 2. The paranormal; whether you believe in Christ or not, is not looking at all the evidence. Now I was not a Christian for many years after it seemed to not work out, mainly bc it didn‚Äôt seem to add up in my head. Among other problems, including anger with God. But I finally became a Christian again after supernatural events in my life took place. And even then, I still had doubts (still do) but one time-I Moved To nyc. I became homeless for about a year-and in order to wait for an apartment had to go through a yr long waiting period at a shelter. To qualify. Bc of a very old diagnosis of depression I was sent Into a MICA shelter: This means chemically addicted and mentally ill. And let me tell you, if you don‚Äôt believe in demons, just go stay at a place like this for a while. You will surely have a less closed opinion. One night I was praying for a woman  next to me bc she wouldn‚Äôt stop coughing and since there was 30 ppl to a room it was under my breath. No one could hear. She was asleep. But she spoke to me. Or rather they spoke to me. Snakes. It sounded like multiple male snakes and they were quoting scriptures at me. They were also addressing me! Let me tell you, I was never the same after this. Surely I thought, if demons are real, and they know the name of Jesus. Then Jesus is who he says he his. Bc they said this too. They said his name was the name above all names. Anyway. I think your appeal to logic is admirable but you will find, that Christianity, although ancient. Is the most logical religion. It provides complete forgiveness and atonement for sin. Through the sacrifice of Jesus on a cross. And yes, a facet of a fallen world is demonic, and yes, it does sound crazy at times.

I don&#39;t think that we should ban guns. Then only the rich, militia, policing agencies, and the military would be allowed to own them legally. Plus because of our gun culture it wouldn&#39;t be like Great Britain or Australia where a small percentage of criminals have or have access to guns. There are SO MANY guns in this country any criminal that wanted one would have easy access for at least 50 years. So the groups that I mention are the groups that scare me most. I do have a plan though, a gun cap. Citizens can own as many guns as they wish that were manufactured prior to 1900. Now the cap, the total number of guns that the citizenry can&#39;t exceed the total population of our country. Part 2, individual cap of 1 gun for an individual years 18-22 (must be a hunting rifle or shotgun). Years 23-29 can own 2 also must be hunting rifle or shotgun. The full cap kicks in at 30 with 3 guns, now you can have any gun that is legal to purchase, however you&#39;re not allowed more than 1 handgun. The militia can&#39;t own separate weapons, the guns must be provided by the members and meet cap requirements. I&#39;m not a gun guy, don&#39;t own one so the next part isn&#39;t something that I care to research but some gun types and gun accessories need to be banned. Assault weapons, 30 round handgun clips, and many other I&#39;m sure. Certain things that are banned must made available to militia members because of that stupid outdated 2nd. However all militia members must be in a national public accessible database. Oddly enough I think we have about 300 million guns and citizens at this time. Only about 20% of the citizenry own about 70% of these guns ( I just pulled that educated guess 20/70 out of my ass). So the government will have to allow people to sell their guns to people in other countries via a treaty or the government will have to have some kind of buy off program. The first one is far more viable because these fuckheads won&#39;t want to be selling their guns so if they can get top dollar from some rich guy in Saudi it&#39;s more likely to work. The most important thing is if someone is caught with more than their allotment it&#39;s a federal offense, a felony, and a per gun mandatory minimum sentence. I just came up with this shit, nice pipe dream. They&#39;ll never take the guns away.

Also, ALL NEW WATER PIPES HAVE TO BE TESTED AND THE WATER SAMPLED TO ASSURE SAFE POTABLE WATER. The cost to re-new ALL mains and services will be MASSIVE.

I did water testing for my state, testing for heavy metals in drinking water, as well as mercury in fish and leaves. If high lead levels were found, the local health Dept in my state would have been all over it. I think what happened is they were collecting water samples in such a way as to hide the problem. They found ways to collect from homes that they knew didn&#39;t have a problem, to say there was no problem.<br><br>Blaming lab people and scientists is just another attempt of the GOP to throw science and facts under the bus!  Such a liar.  People who go into the sciences don&#39;t do it for money, b/c they don&#39;t get paid nearly what they should!  At age 23, I was in charge of ALL the HIV/HEP testing for my entire state, being paid only $12.89/hr! It was a HUGE responsibility. I also took part in the development of the HIV-2 test. All while getting paid only $12.89/hr!<br><br>So, as much as I understand people wanting and needing $15/hr, all the other wages would have to be bumped up too, and they are not going to let that happen.  It took me another 7 years, post-college, to get up to $20/hr (age 30).  So, to start people off at $15/hr in a job that takes no critical thinking skills, is a slap in the face to those of us STILL with college debt from very hard degrees, who never got a decent wage after getting their degrees.<br><br>Doctors can NOT do their jobs without people like me, yet lab workers and nurses get paid shite! These female dominated professions need a huge pay bump to make raising the minimum wage fair. Otherwise, where is the payoff for going to college and doing a job that helps people not die? Clearly the money to pay employees better wages is there, since the health care industry is making huge profits.  I can say that the cost of say, a glucose test, or liver function tests, or any clinical chemistry test is WAY overpriced. I know that researchers only get charged about $2/test when they need labs run, but a patient could be charged $20 for that one test!<br><br>Another example of waste/inefficiency- I need B12 shots to live and it&#39;s a $10-$20/mo shot, out of pocket. I do not have an extra $240/yr to do this at home. I made the diagnosis in 1999, and my Dr confirmed with a blood test.  Prior to 2014, I was able to do them at home and pay out of pocket b/c they cost about $2-$4/mo b/c Medicare doesn&#39;t cover &quot;vitamins,&quot; even though their websites says they would cover this b/c I need it to LIVE. Yet, they STILL won&#39;t cover it for me to do at home.<br><br>So, what has happened is that now I must go into the clinic and have a nurse give me the shot (so it&#39;s covered), which takes a ton of extra time, then they turn around and overcharge the Medicare fund $150 for that $10-$20 shot!   It used to be $20, but recently my Dr wrote a script for four shots and it came out to about $10/shot. The pharmacy also tricked me into paying $24 for SIX syringes, and I was like, &quot;NO WAY, that&#39;s a scam when you can get a box of 100 online for $16!&quot;<br><br>I was so low in B12, I couldn&#39;t even remember to get the shot! They turned it into a huge hassle and there&#39;s some fad out there of people using B12 shots when they don&#39;t need them, and it&#39;s driving the price up for real patients who will die slowly and painfully without them<br><br>I&#39;ve called and written Medicare, the head of Health and Human Services, and other departments. My Dr has tried to appeal, but Medicare has made it SO difficult with a seven part process that people give up!  He asked his clinic supervisor if he can just give me the vials and they said no! <br><br>It&#39;s the intention of government, insurance, doctors and healthcare industry to drain the Medicare/Medicaid fund on PURPOSE by overcharging, so they can say it&#39;s broke. The middlemen of insurance MUST GO. They just add red tape.  Maybe I need a gofundme page to pay for these shots.

Imagine it going across the page getting ever higher.  Now imagine a second line showing the number of gun owners.  It goes up also, but at a slower rate than the number of guns on the streets.  This is because every gun sold doesn&#39;t mean a new gun owner.  People buy multiple guns, so the number of gun owners goes up when more guns are sold, but at a slower rate.  Now imagine a third line, this represents gun suicides, and it goes up at the rate of the first line.  Now, when the gun suicide line catches and crosses the gun owner line, we&#39;ve eliminated gun violence in America.  Simple math. We just need to sell enough guns to drive the gun owner suicide rate above the gun ownership rate  I&#39;m still working it out, but it looks like Rick and the NRA might actually be on to something.'}, {'author_display_name': 'tregonzo', 'comment_text': 'wasn&#39;t it guns and booze about 90yrs ago that caused so much chaos?'}]}, {'video_id': 'Vlb6tYmgbOI', 'view_count': 8836, 'like_count': 230, 'publication_date': '2016-01-08T00:37:59Z', 'top_comments': [{'author_display_name': 'Midnight Rambler', 'comment_text': 'Blacks suffer most from open borders'}, {'author_display_name': 'Drew Drummer', 'comment_text': 'holy shit...how tight are those tops the women on fox are wearing....tits...tits...tits...'}, {'author_display_name': 'Dash Riprock', 'comment_text': 'Very touching but I&#39;m not buying it.
